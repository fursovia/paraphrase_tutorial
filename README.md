# Neural Networks with Attention Mechanism for Efficient Paraphrase Retrieval

In this tutorial, we study the task of modeling a system, which aims to compare two sentences and identify the relationship between them.
In particular, we will develop a paraphrase identification model, and use it to determine whether two sentences are paraphrase or not.
The tutorial covers baseline approaches to solving this task, attention mechanisms in NLP, techniques to speed up inference and how a paraphrase identification task can replace text classification task.

This tutorial is prepared for [RAAI Summer School 2019](http://school-raai.org).
